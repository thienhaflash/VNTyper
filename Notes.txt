VNTyper Version 0.5

=========== TODO ============

1.	Add a [V] button that will attach to the currently edit textfield, a shortcut to enabled/disable VNTyper
2.	Add context menu to access extended functionalities like auto change encoder
3.	Implement encoder probabilites checks when paste text from clipboard
4.	Add spell checking (?)
5.	Add return to english if spelling check fail (?)
6.	Implement auto test input string (input > output)
7.	Fix caret position bug in VniEncoder (automatically move the caret to the correct position, perform addition check when delete/backspace)

=========== Strings to test ============

=========== Developer's Notes ============ 

This part is for anyone who wants to contribute or dive into the code to understand how things in this library works

1. Core			: 
	Char <-- Vowel, Consonant : Dictionary and utilities for VN single characters (add, remove accent, caret, find the base, origin, uppercase/lowercase)
	Word 		: 4 parts - firstC, vowel, lastC, remain : Check if a key is valid accent/ caret or not to be put into the current word, split word into parts and join
	VNTyperCore	: Processing a textfield's input, use Word to check and replace the typing text when neccessary to form VN words
	Encoder		: Base class for all encoders
	TypeMode	: Base class for all TypeModes
	
2.	Encoders	: by default a null encoder will be unicode based
		VniEncoder : Use for Vni fonts
		(you can add more Encoders like TCVN by extending Encoder just like VniEncoder)
		
3.	TypeModes	: by default VNTyper use TelexVni mode
		VniMode		: Use VNI input style (numeric for accents and carets)
		TelexMode	: Use Telex input style (Alphabet for accents and carets)
		TelexVniMode: Mix of Telex and Vni mode (can use both numeric or alphabets for accents and carets)
		(you can add more TypingModes like VIQR, MS VI, ... by extending TypeMode just like VniEncoder)

=========== BUG FIXES ============ 

#0001	: word split should be based on caret position so people can put the caret onto the previously part of the word only
